Need to compare qemu patch files between old 2.5.0 and my 4.2.1,
see if I missed describing any major changes I had to make.
====

Need to work out the right list of hardware for EOS in Kconfig.
For now I copied the existing DIGIC block.

====

ide_hd_initfn(), "forcing IDE type to IDE_CFATA", things moved 
around a bit, I can see where this probably goes, but I'm going
to leave it unchanged for now to see if Qemu fixed this in a more
generic way in the 5 years since update.  Looks possible.

====

I skipped this one because the pattern has changed in 4.2.1 and
there's a specific comment saying not to set it to a hardcoded value.

+/* fixme: how to change this property from machine code? */
 static Property arm_cpu_pmsav7_dregion_property =
-            DEFINE_PROP_UINT32("pmsav7-dregion", ARMCPU, pmsav7_dregion, 16);
+            DEFINE_PROP_UINT32("pmsav7-dregion", ARMCPU, pmsav7_dregion, 8);

====

m_helper.c, the "this is a lie" part has changed in structure quite a lot.
It's possible they're doing, or undoing, some of the work of the
patch here.  The patch applies with minimal changes so I'm trying
it as is for now.

====

Removed DPRINTF from sd.c, because Qemu doesn't use DPRINTF anymore.
You're supposed to use tracing instead.
I'm unsure if this means we'll fail tests due to differences in output.

====

ARM_FEATURE_MPU has been retired:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-arm/2017-04/msg00292.html
There is now ARM_FEATURE_PMSA, but this is not strictly equivalent.
I skimmed the code changes, and I *guess* we can use ARM_FEATURE_PMSA
equivalently, because Qemu code does additional checks based on this
feature flag.  Not sure though!

====

env->c15.c6_rgnr has become env->pmsav7.rnr[] :(
Looks like you're supposed to use rnr[M_REG_S] or rnr[M_REG_NS]
depending on if you're "secure" or "not secure", it relates to
v8M security extensions (even though this is v7?).
I don't know which to use.  Let's guess NS since these are old
tiny CPUs.

====

memory_region_sync_dirty_bitmap() has been removed.
I believe this is no longer needed, but I can't find a good source
and don't fully understand it.  So I'm not sure.
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-02/msg02532.html

====

memory_region_get_dirty() has been removed because "it's never used anywhere":
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-05/msg04349.html
Now that's a good argument for getting our changes upstream...
There have been a bunch of changes to VM in Qemu so let's hope they
handle this for us...
Not confident about this change but it looks like worst it'll do is mess
up Qemu graphical display.

====

cpu_arm_init() got replaced by cpu_generic_init(), which was
replaced by cpu_init(), which was then replaced!
I believe this is now cpu_create().
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-02/msg00999.html

====

qemu_char_get_next_serial() has been removed.  This is not a trivial
change for us.
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-05/msg04383.html

I've tried adding props in a similar way to their Digic example,
but we were using MachineClass not DeviceClass.  I'm not sure my
naive method of using both will work.

I've put the prop initialisation into eos_init_common() for now
but I suspect we should move more init into realize() (doesn't
currently exist), as I think this is the right way.

====

Related to the above, EOSState uart changes, because DigicUartState struct
was CharDriverState *chr but is now CharBackend chr.
